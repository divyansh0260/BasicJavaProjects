# Basic Java Programs

As I learn Java, I have decided to upload my newly written programs on Github.
This repo is public beacuse I wanted it to be......hehehe



## Available Programs

For now the programs I have written are:


1. [Checking if an array is sorted or not, if yes then finding the Sorting Manner.](https://github.com/divyansh0260/BasicJavaProjects/blob/main/01-ArraySorting.java)

2. [Simple programs using Recursion only.](https://github.com/divyansh0260/BasicJavaProjects/blob/main/02%20-%20Recursion.java)
