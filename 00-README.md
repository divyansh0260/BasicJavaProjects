# Basic Java Programs

As I learn Java, I have decided to upload my newly written programs on Github.
This repo is public beacuse I wanted it to be......hehehe



## Available Programs

For now the programs I have written are:


1. Checking if an array is sorted or not, if yes then finding the Sorting Manner.

2. Simple programs using Recursion only.
